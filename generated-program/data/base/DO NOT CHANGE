In this directory are the default images of the authui.dll. The Logon Changer won't work right if you change(delete) these, i.e. it won't even start. Why? Just cause ;) (Because I don't want that you have trouble with a broken logon)
The background.png is only used by the previewscreen in the editor, not for the default logon.
The uifile contains the layout, which the program uses as base.
You can use the previewDefault.png as an example for your logon previews.


IF YOU CHANGED THE IMAGES AND WANT NOW TO APPLY THE DEFAULT LOGON PLEASE REDOWNLOAD THE PROGRAM.



BTW.: IF YOU CHANGE ANY FILES OF THE PROGRAM IT MAY NOT WORK PROPERLY. Keep that in mind :)
